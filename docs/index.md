**AddressBook is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
-->

**GamerBook Pro Max is a desktop application for gamers who play multiplayer online games to track gaming friends.**
It helps users manage contact details of a small group of personal gaming friends, tracking which games they play and their usernames across different platforms.
